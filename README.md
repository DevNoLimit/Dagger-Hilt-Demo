<h1>Dagger-Hilt-Demo</h1>

<p>This project is a simple demonstration of using Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection in an Android application.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <ol>
      <li>Clone the repository:</li>
      <pre>git clone https://github.com/DevNoLimit/Dagger-Hilt-Demo.git</pre>
      <li>Open the project in Android Studio.</li>
      <li>Ensure you have the latest Android SDK and tools installed.</li>
      <li>Run the application on an emulator or device.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Understanding the Code</h2>

<p>This project consists of the following key components:</p>

<ul>
        <li><strong>Application class:</strong> This class is annotated with <code>@HiltAndroidApp</code> to mark it as the entry point for dependency injection using Hilt.</li>
        <li><strong>Modules:</strong> Modules define how objects are provided and their dependencies. This project might include modules for providing network services, repositories, view models, etc. (depending on the complexity).</li>
        <li><strong>Injectable classes:</strong> Classes that need dependencies can be annotated with <code>@Inject</code> to be eligible for dependency injection. Hilt will automatically inject the required dependencies at runtime.</li>
    </ul>

 <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a basic example, and the specific implementation details will vary based on your project's needs.</p>

  <h2>Running the Demo</h2>

  <p>The demo application showcases a simple example of injecting a dependency. You can modify and extend this code to demonstrate more complex scenarios in your own projects.</p>
    
    
<p>This readme provides a starting point for understanding the project. Feel free to explore the code further and experiment with different functionalities of Dagger-Hilt.</p>
